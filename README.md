# TBM-performance-prediction-and-rock-mass-grade
An LSTM-based model for TBM performance prediction and the effect of rock mass grade on prediction accuracy

**The work is going to be published on China Civil Engineering Journal. More information will be updated ......**

**Abstract** : The massive data collected by a working Tunnel Boring Machine(TBM) make data-driven TBM performance prediction models possible. To explore the effect of surrounding rock mass grade on model prediction accuracy, given the rising stage data of a TBM advancing cycle, three long and short term memory(LSTM) models were established to predict the thrust and torque in the stable stage......
