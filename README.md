An LSTM-based model for TBM performance prediction and the effect of rock mass grade on prediction accuracy


**Abstract** : The massive data collected by a working Tunnel Boring Machine(TBM) make data-driven TBM performance prediction models possible. To explore the effect of surrounding rock mass grade on model prediction accuracy, given the rising stage data of a TBM advancing cycle, three long and short term memory(LSTM) models were established to predict the thrust and torque in the stable stage......
